# COVID-FINAL-PROJECT
This is my Final project.
This project is divided into different parts.
1. Data Collection
The data source is divided into different parts, and you will combine the data to
perform analysis and provide insights.

1. The Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC) monitors the countryâ€™s COVID-
19 situations, and releases data on metrics across all the 37 states in the country.
From NCDC COVID-19 official website(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8548039/table/germs-11-03-391-t002/?report=objectonly), you will obtain the data by performing a
web extraction or web scraping.

2. The Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU
CSSE) publishes daily data on confirmed, death and recovered cases across
different countries. I accessED the daily data for Nigeria from the repository (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv)
and derive related insights.
3. Real Domestic Gross Product Data
We have provided data on the Real Domestic Gross Product(GDP) data for Nigeria. i imported the data to visualize the impact of COVID-19 on the economy.
4. State Budget Data
States across the country reduced their initial budget due to the impact of COVID-19 on the economy.

Data Cleaning and Preparation
I performed data cleaning an preparation by doing the tasks below:
a. Convert to appropriate data type.
b. Rename the columns of the scraped data.
c. Remove comma(,) in numerical data
d. Extracting daily data for Nigeria from the Global daily cases data.

I also generated a few plots using the datasets and also merged the datasets to analyze and visualize some data points.
